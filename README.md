# BMI-calculator

This is a responsive, Romanian-language web application that serves as a personal Health & Fitness Calculator.
Based on the code, the application does the following:
Gathers User Data: It provides a clean, user-friendly form for users to input their personal metrics:
Weight (kg)
Height (cm)
Age
Gender
Daily activity level
Performs Key Calculations: Using this data, it calculates several important health and fitness metrics:
BMI (Body Mass Index): To determine if the user's weight is in a healthy range.
BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate): The number of calories the body needs at rest.
TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure): An estimate of the total calories burned per day, which serves as the daily calorie need for weight maintenance.
Macronutrients: A recommended daily intake (in grams) for protein, carbohydrates, and fats based on the calculated TDEE.
Displays Personalized Results: The results are presented in a clear and visually appealing way:
The user's BMI is shown prominently, along with its category (e.g., "Normal Weight," "Overweight").
Each BMI category comes with a detailed, color-coded explanation in Romanian to help the user understand their result.
The daily calorie and macronutrient needs are displayed in separate, easy-to-read cards.
In essence, it's a practical tool that helps Romanian-speaking users get a quick overview of their current health status and provides a scientific basis for their daily diet and calorie goals.
